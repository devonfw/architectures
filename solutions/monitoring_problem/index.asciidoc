== Monitoring Introduction
=== Context & Problem
==== Terminology

_Used definition: A monitoring solution helps the monitoring consumer achieve the satisfactory level of control of a defined service_. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor/observability[Link to source])

This definition already includes the following:

* *Defined service:* The resources you want to monitor aka monitored resources. The resources to be monitored can be split in infrastructure and applications on top. 
* *Level of control:* That is your bandwidth in which your defined service operates normally aka known as baseline
* *Measuring:* A measurement is a single act that quantifies an attribute of a part, equipment, service or process (CPU load, available memory etc.). Data measured is emitted by the monitored resources and aka telemetry. 
* *Monitoring consumer:* The user trying to keep the service within its baseline boundaries.

The key to achieve that is a single control plane is usually preferred to simplify the operations for the consumer aka monitoring plane. The relevant content depends on the perspective of the consumer such as performance, costs, compliance and health. Performance in this pattern includes the following as described https://github.com/uglide/azure-content/blob/master/articles/best-practices-monitoring.md[here]:

** *Health monitoring:* purpose of health monitoring is to generate a snapshot of the current health of the system so that you can verify that all components of the system are functioning as expected.
** *Error monitoring:* Bugs & errors need to be detected by monitoring. Supporting information must be provided that allows monitoring consumer to analyze the root cause.
** *Availability monitoring:* A truly healthy system requires that the components and subsystems that compose the system are available. Availability monitoring is closely related to health monitoring. But whereas health monitoring provides an immediate view of the current health of the system, availability monitoring is concerned with tracking the availability of the system and its components to generate statistics about the uptime of the system.
** *Performance monitoring:* As the system is placed under more and more stress (by increasing the volume of users), the size of the datasets that these users access grows and the possiblity of failure of one or more components becomes more likely. Frequently, component failure is preceded by a decrease in performance. If you're able detect such a decrease, you can take proactive steps to remedy the situation.
** *SLA Monitoring:* SLA monitoring is closely related to performance monitoring. But whereas performance monitoring is concerned with ensuring that the system functions *optimally*, SLA monitoring is governed by a contractual obligation that defines what optimally actually means. You can calculate the percentage availability of a service over a period of time by using the following formula: `%Availability =  ((Total Time – Total Downtime) / Total Time ) * 100`

Providing a control plane requires a monitoring pipeline that should be implemented as feedback loop. The pipeline transforms raw telemetry into meaningful information that the monitoring consumer can use to determine the state of the system. The loop ensures that lessons learnt are the starting point for further improvements on the defined service side. E.g. by adaptive scaling depending on monitored traffic. The entire monitoring must be compliant and provide integration features. The conceptual stages of the pipeline are as follows:

* Data Sources/ Instrumention (Monitored resources): concerned with identifying the sources from where the telemetry needs to be captured, determining which data to capture and how to capture it.
* Collection/ Storage (Monitoring plane)
* Analysis/ Diagnosis (Monitoring plane): generate meaningful information that an monitoring consumer can use to determine the state of the system
* Visualization/ Alerting (Monitoring plane): decisions about possible actions to take and then feed the results back into the instrumentation and collection stages

The picture below summarizes the aspects:

==== Standard Problems

The list below describes the standard problems that apply independent from the monitoring consumer perspective. Solutions with concrete technology are first described in subsequent chapters. Per monitoring pipeline stage the following standard problems are known:

* *Data Sources/ Instrumention (Monitored Resources)*
+
--
This also includes the possibility of preprocessing to reduce or enrich sent telemtry data to the monitoring consumer. Telemetry itself might be of different structure and convey different information.
--
* *Collection/ Storage (Monitoring Plane)*
+
--
The drop location of the telemetry needs to be determined such as inside the monitoring plane or externally.

Monitoring can result in a large amount of data. Storing such granular data is costly. Therefore an archiving mechanism is required to make sure costs are not exploding. Once archived the ingested telemetry should be removed.
--
* *Analysis/ Diagnosis (Monitoring Plane)*
+
--
Includes standard problems like:

** Filtering
** Aggregation
** Correlation
** Reformating
** Comparison against Key Performance Indicatorss (=KPIs). KPIs have no weight in software development unless they are paired with your business goals. You don’t need a handful of KPI metrics for your software team. All you need is the right KPI to help you improve your product or process. KPIs should be SMART (S = Specific; M = Measureable; A = Assignable; R = Realistic; T = Time Bound). Examples: Code Quality KPIs such as Maintainability index, Complexity metrics, Depth of inheritance, Class coupling, Lines of code; Testing Quality such as Test effort, Test coverage; Availability = Mean time between failures, Mean time to recovery/ repair https://stackify.com/metrics-monitoring-choosing-the-right-kpis/[as described here]
--
* *Visualization/ Alerting (Monitoring Plane)*
+
--
Includes standard problems like:

** Visualization for monitoring consumer
** Alerts: *Programmatic action* that free the monitoring consumer from manual intervention. It states the trigger and the action to bee executed. One challenging aspect is to minimize the number of alerts or to detect patterns behind multiple alerts. Infering a suitable thresholds can be challing especially if the threshold is not static.
** Reports
** Ad-hoc queries
** Exploration
--
* *Improving Feedback Loop (Plane/ Resources)*
+
--
Cases where the monitored resources operated outside their baseline should be the starting point for improvements. This might mean a better tuning of alerts and intervention or system requirements.
--

Integrating and compliance affect the entire pipeline. Telemetry might have to be collected from other systems to achieve a single monitoring plane. However alerts/ notications might have to be forwarded to other systems.
Of course a monitoring must be compliant regarding the enterprise guidelines.

The following patterns are not dicussed here:

* Provisioning of the monitoring plane and the monitored resourves
