== Enduser Management Solutions - Azure Active Directory
=== Overview Azure Active Directory

The central control instance for all users within Azure is Azure Active Directory (AAD). It comes with the following features/ services that can be used for enduser management:

* AAD Business to Customer (B2C)
+
--
This feature started with the idea to cover endusers of an application. The feature comes with a special B2C tenant in which the users are located.
--
* AAD Business to Business (B2B)
+
--
This feature started with the idea to give external users access to Azure resources in an existing tenant. The external are modeled as guest users in AAD. This feature can be also used for modeling endusers especially if the same tenant is not problematic. A big advantage is that problems related to the separate B2C tenant are not relevant such as provisioning.
--

Currently there is a lot of movement in this area. Microsoft was already porting features from B2C to B2B. The new external identities marks the shift towards even more integration between the two. Currently it refers to two things: (1) the new umbrella term unifying the so far separate B2B/ B2C features and (2) additional features that were added to AAD B2B. According to https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/atvwr79957/attachments/atvwr79957/UK_Area_db/387/2/External%20Identities.pdf[this source] this might mean a unified service offering that combines the B2B and B2C features.
According to feedback from the microsoft product group it probably does not mean a a new separate service that unifies the existing B2B and B2C. The majority is voting for creatin an option within AAD B2B to group the users in a logical container within a tenant. The current hassle could be then avoided that comes with the different B2C one.

=== Enduser Management Application Level
==== Overview

The solution is to use one of the introduced AAD features and the following platform features. The focus of this chapter is to introduce the relevant features. Recommendations for a concrete setup are given in the next chapter.

The relevant AAD features are as follows:

* AAD Application registration
+
--
Applications need to be registered for usage within Azure B2C and B2B. Registration is mandatory for Azure B2C. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/session-behavior?pivots=b2c-user-flow[B2B session settings] define whether a user has access to certain applications only or a wider scope such as single-sign-on for all app registrations in the B2C tenant. For B2B it is only mandatory if users are invited per application (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/add-users-administrator[Scopes] user group and tenant don't require an app registration). App registration contain settings per Applications such as redirect URLs. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-spa[here] for an example of an SPA web application.

* AAD User Management feature
+
--
AAD B2B and B2C can be possible to manage end users. Crucial questions are:

** Is it a problem to store the application users with others in the same tenant? (Since you might have a mixture of corporate and non corporate users)
** Does the separate tenant cause problems? (E.g. because you want to use custom policies which results causes problems regarding https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/deploy-custom-policies-devops[provisioning])
** Feature differences such as https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/compare-with-b2c[Single Sign On]
--
* Monitoring
+
--
Application monitoring can be done via Azure Monitor. However the required steps for setting it up differ from standard. It requires even https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/azure-monitor[additional services] such as Azure Lighthouse due to the separate tenant.
--
* Compliance
+
--
Azure User features can be combined with various other Azure services/ AAD features to strengthen security. This includes:

** Azure sentinel for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/azure-sentinel[security analytics] based on routing/ audit logs forwarded 
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/identity-protection-investigate-risk?pivots=b2c-user-flow[AD B2C Identity Protection] provides two reports. The Risky users report is where administrators can find which users are at risk and details about detections. The risk detections report provides information about each risk detection, including type, other risks triggered at the same time, sign-in attempt location and more.

==== Detailed AAD User Management Features

The AAD features support the following out of the box:

* Application
+
--
Microsoft provides AAD libraries that wrap the required functionalities including sign in/ ou/ up. 
--
* Enduser managment
+
--
The AAD supports the following:

** *Flows:* Supported out of the box. HTML/ CSS customization of required pages is possible. Flows are defined declarativ via XML.
** *Custom logic:* Can be implemented via functions.
** *Data store:* Supported entities besides users and organizations (=tenants) can be found here. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-custom-attributes?pivots=b2c-user-flow[Custom attributes] can be added but no own entities.
** *On behalf of:* Is provided out of the box by invitation workflows.
** *Access Reviews:* Is provided out of the box.

==== Variations

Authentication can be done by an external identity provider.

=== Enduser Management Infrastructure Level

The core service is Azure AD. A direct monitoring with Azure Services is hard since the infrastructure monitoring tools also require Azure AD authentication. Possible native tools are:

* Microsoft 365 service health status page
* Microsoft 365 admin center
+
--
The Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard (SHD) doesn't send notifications about Azure AD service outages and only shows this information in a dashboard, which administrators have to pull up and analyze (link to https://www.manageengine.com/microsoft-365-management-reporting/azure-active-directory-monitoring-tool.html[Source]).
