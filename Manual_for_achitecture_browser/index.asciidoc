=== Can be done automatically
If the extension is helpful to anyone who works on the project, you can add it to the 
.gitpod.yml configuration file so that it gets installed for anyone who works on the project. To do that:

. Visit the extension page (where you installed it from)
. Click the settings icon
. Select “Add to .gitpod.yml” from the menu

Your project’s .gitpod.yml is updated automatically and lists the given extension. You can also directly edit this file to install or remove extensions manually.

Here is an example of what a .gitpod.yml with installed extensions may look like:

```
vscode:
 extensions:
    - asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode

```

You can share the installed extensions with your team by committing the .gitpod.yml change and pushing it to your Git repository.
