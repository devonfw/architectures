That is important to accept CLA if not yet done.

== Stack specific solution
A stack specific solution is the place where you can find all the solutions of each stack. Each specific solution has a different prefix.
So in devon4j.wiki there is e.g. a solutions folder, then every subfolder in this solution folder has the prefix devon4j_ .

You should do each solution on a new branch and not take the master branch because that can lead to conflicts.
